Pluses:
GLS control
Enough species for in-group variation
Unified model combines previous discoveries



Mid CDS
Katz: mean (mid-CDS). Bacteria most




-------------------------------------------
Katz
-------------------------------------------

High-level: 28 species, across the tree of life, mean.

Bacteria: Largely negative dLFE, with some neutral and one positive.
Archaea: mostly no bias, with 2/8 positive
Eukaryotic: "sporadic" negative dLFE, with cerevisiae showing positive. Mostly neutral.

Keller
-------------------------------------------
145 species (bacteria and archaea)

Evidence for selection: functional genes have positive dLFE near CDS starts, non-functional genes do not.

Conflict: this is not universal

HSR 30-80

Z-score based on normal distribution
With a step-size of 9, all windows are in-phase.

Gu (2010)
-------------------------------------------

High-level: 340 species, across the tree of life, window 0.

GC is the main determinant of dLFE in window 0 (strong positive correlation)


Methods drawbacks:

No GLS control
No other controls?

No differentitation of start vs. mid for the sake of GC influence (positive vs. negative correlation of GC vs. dLFE). Focus on start (assuming this part is the most imporant).
no discussion of outliers
Less taxonomic granularity in general - bacteria vs. metazoan clades
Statistics based on Z-score (not aparametric distribution)
Very low N for many subgroups
Less discussion of diversity within and between groups
No analysis of dLFE except right after CDS start

Contrasting conclusions:

E-coli profile is followed by "most species... except for plants and warm-blooded animals (birds and mammals)." (p. 2). 10/11 Fungi also follow this pattern (p. 2, p. 4).
Temperature effect - found same results; interpreted them as negative correlation (Fig. 4). Attributed to thermodynamic stability in discussion (p. 5).
